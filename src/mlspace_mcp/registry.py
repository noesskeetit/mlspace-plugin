"""Declarative umbrella-tool model + the generic dispatcher.

Each domain module declares pure DATA: a ``DomainTool`` whose ``actions`` map
(action name → :class:`Op`) is the single source of truth for action→endpoint.
ALL mechanics — readonly enum-stripping, path templating, repeated-query
encoding, body attachment, required-param validation, confirm gating,
pagination clamp, response formatting, annotations — live here, once. Domain
modules cannot drift on mechanics because they contain none.
