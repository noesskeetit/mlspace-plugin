"""Response shaping for tool output.

v1 policy (deliberately minimal — see DESIGN.md §formatting):
- default ``json``: compact structured passthrough with an explicit, testable
  noise-key drop list (k8s manifest cruft) — NOT a universal recursive markdown
  renderer, which mangles the manifests many GET endpoints return.
- long strings (base64 images, embedded blobs) are elided with a size note.
- arrays are capped to ``list_cap`` rendered rows with a "… N more" footer.
- caller-supplied ``redact_keys`` are masked (credential-returning reads).
- ``kind="log"`` returns the last ``log_tail`` lines with a truncation header.
- ``kind="catalog"`` losslessly de-duplicates the configs cross-product: the
  same heavy image objects are re-listed under every instance_type, so we hoist
  them into a per-region ``image_catalog`` and leave light ``name:tag`` refs in
  place (the exact per-instance image mapping is preserved). Fail-open on shape.
